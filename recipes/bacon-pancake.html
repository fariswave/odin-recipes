  <h2>Description</h2>

    Bacon Pancake is a breakfast dish blending crispy bacon with fluffy pancakes, creating a sweet-savory delight. Cooked by incorporating bacon strips into the pancake batter, it offers a unique flavor combination. Often served with maple syrup, it's a popular and indulgent breakfast choice.

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>12 ounces center-cut thick-cut sliced bacon (about 12 slices)</li>
    <li>1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon granulated sugar</li>
    <li>1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
    <li>3/4 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
    <li>2 cups buttermilk</li>
    <li>2 large eggs</li>
    <li>4 tablespoons (1/2 stick) unsalted butter, plus more for the pan</li>
    <li>Maple syrup, for serving</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Working in batches if needed, place 12 ounces bacon in a single layer on a griddle or in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Cook, flipping occasionally, until just crisp, 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer the bacon to a paper towel-lined plate. Wipe the griddle or skillet clean with paper towels (pour off the grease and reserve before wiping if you want to use it to cook the pancakes).
    </li>
    <li>
      Place 1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour, 1 tablespoon granulated sugar, 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder, 1 teaspoon baking soda, and 3/4 teaspoon kosher salt in a large bowl and whisk to combine.
    </li>
    <li>
      Place 2 cups buttermilk and 2 large eggs in a medium bowl and whisk to combine. Melt 4 tablespoons unsalted butter in the microwave or on the stovetop. Add the buttermilk mixture to the flour mixture, then add the melted butter. Stir until just combined — the batter should lumpy. Let rest 5 minutes. Meanwhile, heat the griddle or skillet over medium heat.
    </li>
    <li>
      Coat the pan with a thin layer of butter or bacon grease. Place 1 strip of the bacon in the pan and pour 1/4 cup batter over the center of the strip, allowing it to spread out and form a circle about 4 inches wide. Repeat with more strips of bacon and batter to fill the space on the griddle or skillet. (In a 12-inch skillet, you should be able to fit about 5 pancakes.) Cook until the bubbles form on the top and the bottoms are golden-brown, 3 to 4 minutes, adjusting the heat as needed. Flip the pancakes and cook until the second side is golden-brown, 2 to 3 minutes more.
    </li>
    <li>
      Transfer to plates or a 200ºF oven to keep warm. Repeat cooking the remaining strips of bacon and batter. Serve drizzled with maple syrup.
